# GridGL
This is a OpenGL based game engine written in C++.

This is purely an exersice for myself after learning the basics of C++ and OpenGL, and is not meant to be used by others. Although I won't stop you if you want to :)

## Current status
This is currently WIP, and doesn't do much.

## Building and running
This project uses CMake, so you need to have that installed.

### Test application
This is setup to compile with the engine dynamically for development purposes.

```
cd Test-Application
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
./TestApp
```
